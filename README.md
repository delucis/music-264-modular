# Readme
This is the central patch for the Music 264 “Modular” project.

## Keeping an updated copy on your computer

1. After installing [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) or [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/), click **[Clone in Desktop](github-mac://openRepo/https://github.com/mus264/music-264-modular)**. Follow the on-screen instructions and choose a sensible place to save the repository.

2. Now, to make sure the version on your computer is up-to-date, simply click **Sync** in the top-right of the GitHub software on your computer.

**N.B.** If you make any changes to the files on your computer, this will probably cause problems with syncing. If you’re having problems check the ‘Changes’ tab in the GitHub software. Just opening the main Max patch will change parts of it (for example by updating file paths) and these will show up as changes (remember that the main patch autosaves every 60 seconds). You can safely discard these changes by right-clicking on each file that has changed and selecting **Discard Changes…**.

### Mac OS X 10.8
The current version of GitHub for Mac requires OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) or higher. If you are running 10.8, you can download the last compatible version **[here](https://j.mp/1zklqpL)**.

### Keeping your fork updated
After you have created your own fork, you will want to keep it updated by getting the latest changes from the master version. There are two ways to do this. You should use the **first** in all cases, *unless* you are extremely comfortable using the command line and have taken some time to understand using git in the command line.
