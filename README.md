# Readme
This is the central patch for the Music 264 “Modular” project.

Please [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) this to your own account.

If you make any changes that you think should be integrated into the main patch for everyone, [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/).

## Keeping your fork updated
After you have created your own fork, you will want to keep it updated by getting the latest changes from the master version. There are two ways to do this. You should use the first in all cases, ***unless*** you are extremely comfortable using the command line and have taken some time to understand using git in the command line.

1. [Updating a fork directly from GitHub](http://www.hpique.com/2013/09/updating-a-fork-directly-from-github/)
2. [Syncing a fork from the command line](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/)
