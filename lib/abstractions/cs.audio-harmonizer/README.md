# `[cs.audio-harmonizer]`
Module for the [Music 264 “Modular”](https://github.com/mus264/music-264-modular).

Will receive audio signal, combine it with pitch-shifted versions of itself and output a harmonized version of the audio.

## Goals

### Input

* ~~Accept stereo audio input~~
* ~~Accept some kind of syntax to control harmonization~~

### Interface

* ~~Build a graphical interface to control harmonization~~

### DSP

* ~~No click when pitches change~~
* ~~Flexible number of voices~~
* Separate UI from DSP?
* ~~Permit individual control of each pitch-shift volume?~~

### Other

* ~~`[pattrstorage]` to store presets~~
